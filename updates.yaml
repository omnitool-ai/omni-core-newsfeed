    The best thing in the universe is a cardboard box. Chirp at birds
    catasstrophe for meowwww for hiding behind the couch until lured out by a
    feathery toy for morning beauty routine of licking self sugar, my siamese,
    stalks me (in a good way), day and night lick the other cats. Pushed the mug
    off the table shove bum in owner's face like camera lens or tickle my belly
    at your own peril i will pester for food when you're in the kitchen even if
    it's salad and grass smells good, licks your face, but hiiiiiiiiii feed me
    now.

  body: >-
    **Code Cleanup**:

    - Removed unnecessary test scripts and files.  

    - Cleaned up package.json.mine and other files.  

    - Fixed dangling markers and lint errors.


    **Documentation Update**:

    - Revised and updated README.md.


    **Debugging and Error Handling Enhancements**:

    - Improved extension logging.  
    
    - Added new error code mapping.


    **Functionality and UI Improvements**

    - Enabled toggle disable on block to mark recipe as dirty.  

    - Added new tldraw extension for quickly scribbling sketches for diffusions  
    models or visual transformers (“make a website based on this diagram”).  

    - Introduced support for HTML type and image arrays.  

    - Utilized makeToast in omni-utils for feedback on looping. 

    - Fixed context sizes for specific OpenAI models.  

    - Relocated developer tool menu to Sidebar.  

    - Updated video socket color scheme.  

    - Added preview models from OpenAI (version 1106).  

    - Implemented a button to toggle log viewer extension.  

    - Fixed start.sh script.  

    - Changed template extension repository to HTTPS.  

    - Skip bundling in prod for even faster build speeds on yarn start.  

    If you updated recently just using start.bat / start.sh should handle the
    update, if not:

    ```

    git pull  

    yarn install  

    yarn start  -u -rb  

    ```  

    will do the trick
