  title: 'New Extension: TLDraw '
  body: >2-
     [TLDraw](https://www.tldraw.com/) is a powerful whiteboarding solution that allows quick creation on diagrams and sketches - perfect for feeding into the new GPT-4 Visual Model or it's Open Source Cousin LLava to try out these new vision transformers - for example by asking them to turn the sketch into a website.

    We also added a new Website Creator recipe to demonstrate these
    capabilities.


    You can find **omni-extension-tldraw** in the Extension Manager in Omnitool
    v0.5.3.

  title: 'Upcoming: Local Model Support'
  body: >+
    Much of AI progress currently is bi-furcated, models from proprietary
    vendors like Google, Anthropic and OpenAI on one side, Open Source models
    such as Stable Diffusion, Meta's LLama Family or Mistral on the other.


    Omnitool strives to bring you the best of both worlds, and with the next
    update, Omnitool will gain the ability to use local APIs of your
    choosing.


    🥳🥳 With the next version of Omnitool, we are shipping support for local AI
    tooling! 🥳🥳


    Initially supported:


    - [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/)  - A local LLM platform running open
    source models based on llama.cpp.

    - [Oobabooga](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui) - Another
    popular local LLM platform with wide compatibility.

    - [Automatic1111](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) -
    The cutting edge Stable Diffusion tooling for your local machine.

    - [SD-Next](https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic) - A polished fork of
    Automatic1111 focusing on usability.

    - [Paperless-ngx](https://docs.paperless-ngx.com/) - A powerful document
    management, indexing and OCR platform.

    - [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/) - A locally hosted vector database for
    embedding storage.

    **But local support does not stop there!**


    These predefined tools ship with blocks created by the omnitool.ai team.
    However, from the next version onwards, you are able to define and load your
    own API definitions directly from the data.local directory of your server,
    allowing you to import any other openapi3 compatible API (or provide your
    own openapi specs for other REST APIs)!

    This means you can create your own blocks going forward!

    **Code Fixes and Updates**

    - Fixed various issues including Eslint being overly aggressive, a bug where the json_unpacker would fail if the json provided was an array, db id, and dir creation order.

    - Made minor fixes, updates, and clean up. Tackled some edge cases and offline situations for community known extensions.

    - Updated error messages, readme, and removed pocketbase.
    

    **New blocks**

    - Read Files from Directory - Read files from <server>/data.local/file-import/<user-id>

    - Write Files to Directory - Write files to  <server>/data.local/file-export/<user-id>


    **Local Templates and Extension**

    - Added support for local templates, server extension in commonJS, and ability to pin extensions to the sidebar. Changed developer tool icon and added newsfeed extensions.

    - Added and fixed features in file_output block, json input to chat_input block, and run_recipe block. Added new huggingface get models block.
    
    - Improved control picking logic for password fields and handling of community extensions.

    - Use the /local command to install or remove local APIs.

    - Initial local templates  include support for:
      - LM-studio,
      - Oobabooga Text Generation UI,
      - Automatic1111/SD-Next,
      - Paperless-ng

    **Database Migration and Integration**

    - Forced pnp.cjs to prevent upstream projects from impacting mercs build. Upgraded yarn to 4.0.2.

    - Ensured to convert object to array for block choice. Marked db migration more stably with file marker write.

    - Moved auth to sqlite db, ensured sqlite db even if migration is not required. Added migration script from pocket to sqlite.

    **User Interface and Experience Improvements**
    - Integrated CDN, created single result socket when schema doesn't have top property, and hid _omni_result socket when patch exists.

    - Removed database admin from the sidebar and old logos. Added tooltip for TextControl and support for version and format on component.

    - Standardized build scripts, explicit sourcemap type, and log feedback. Added support for local templates and extension.

    If you updated recently just using start.bat / start.sh should handle the
    update, if not:

    ```

    git pull

    yarn install

    yarn start  -u -rb

    ```
