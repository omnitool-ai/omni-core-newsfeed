  title: 'New Extension: TLDraw '
  body: >2-
     [TLDraw](https://www.tldraw.com/) is a powerful whiteboarding solution that allows quick creation on diagrams and sketches - perfect for feeding into the new GPT-4 Visual Model or it's Open Source Cousin LLava to try out these new vision transformers - for example by asking them to turn the sketch into a website.

    We also added a new Website Creator recipe to demonstrate these
    capabilities. 


    You can find **omni-extension-tldraw** in the Extension Manager in Omnitool
    v0.5.3.
